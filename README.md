# PollyNarrator
Developed a serverless application using AWS Lambda, S3, and Polly to convert text files into speech. The application automatically generates audio files from text uploaded to an S3 bucket, leveraging AWS Polly for text-to-speech synthesis and stores the audio output in a destination S3 bucket for easy access and download.
